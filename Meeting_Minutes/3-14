Progress Updates (Weekly Status Report)
Vikram Rohit Ramachandra
Worked on connecting the database with the frontend and using user data to attempt login functionality. Collaborated with Saumya during this integration process.
Next Steps: Finish connecting the database with the frontend to ensure smooth login and data retrieval functionality.

Saumya Kapoor
Contributed to backend-frontend integration through pair programming with Vikram. Worked on drafting the system architecture diagram to visualize key components and data flow.
Next Steps: Finalize frontend-backend connection and implement full user authentication.

Nihanth Attaluri
Focused on model research and collaborated with Sruti on training efforts. Helped evaluate model performance and refine feature selection.
Next Steps: Complete fine-tuning of the model and analyze training times for optimization.

Sruti Karthikeyan
Tokenized essays using DistilRoBERTa and extracted key linguistic features. Initially fine-tuned RoBERTa but faced high resource usage, prompting a switch to DistilRoBERTa. Achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0016 and a Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.9022.
Next Steps: Introduce unseen data to assess model generalization and denormalize predicted scores for interpretability.




To-Do List for This Week
