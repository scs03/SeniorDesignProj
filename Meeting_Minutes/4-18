Discussion Highlights
Integration with front end and back end. Training the AI model.

This week, Vikram collaborated with Sriram to implement the integration of teacher-generated queries into the frontend, 
displaying dynamic data through card components. He also designed and developed a functional "Submit Assignment" modal 
on the student submissions page, allowing students to upload assignments and select the relevant task from a dropdown. 
This lays the foundation for a more streamlined submission process. Next week, he plans to finalize backend data integration
for both teacher and student views, removing all hardcoded data.

Sriram addressed merge conflicts in the repository and developed a useSession hook to manage protected dashboard pages, 
resolving hydration errors in the process. He ensured that users attempting to access protected pages without authentication
are redirected to the sign-in page. Additionally, he created queries to fetch the list of classes taught by a teacher, 
including related assignments and class counts. Sriram also integrated GraphQL mutations for login and logout functionalities
and worked alongside Vikram to display the classes dynamically using cards in the frontend. Next week, he will focus on setting
up integrations for assignment creation and finalizing backend connections on the student page.

Sruti identified a significant issue in the scoring model: the generated scores often failed to align with rubric intent due to a
lack of trait-specific guidance. She explored prompt engineering and rubric-aware input strategies to enhance interpretability and
grading alignment. She also investigated retraining approaches using trait-specific rubric prompts and initiated a full retraining
of the Flan-T5 model with these revised inputs. The training, conducted on Google Colab, is limited by session and resource
constraints but remains feasible. Next week, she aims to complete model training, validate scoring accuracy across sample essays,
and begin integration into the backend for automated, rubric-based evaluation.

Saumya worked with Vikram to create a submit assignment button on the student submissions page and focused on UI beautification
efforts to streamline the interface. For the upcoming week, he plans to collaborate with Vikram and Sriram to complete backend and
frontend integration for a seamless submission workflow.

Nihanth spent the week testing the data flow from essay submissions to rubric incorporation, manipulating outputs and JSON structures
to interface correctly with the model. He also collaborated with Sruti to address issues in essay scoring. For next week, his focus will
be on adding an additional layer to enhance the essay scoring process.
