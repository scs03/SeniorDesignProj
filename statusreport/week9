Sruti Karthikeyan
Hours worked: 10
Tasks Completed:

1. Identified a key issue with the previous model: generated scores often failed to match rubric intent because the model lacked trait-specific guidance. Researched prompt engineering and rubric-aware input strategies to make scoring more interpretable and aligned with how teachers grade.

2. Explored multiple retraining options using trait-specific rubric prompts to improve zero-shot scoring reliability.

3. Initiated full retraining of the Flan-T5 model using revised prompts that include explicit trait rubrics for each input. Training is being done on Google Colab, which introduces time and resource constraints (e.g., session timeouts, limited GPU memory), making experimentation slower but still feasible.

Next Week:

1. Finalize model training and begin scoring accuracy checks across a sample of essays.

2. Integrate the finalized model into the overall backend pipeline for automated, rubric-driven essay evaluation.
