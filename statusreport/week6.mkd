Sruti Karthikeyan: ~9

- pair programming with Nihanth to understand scores and how to denormalize them to make some sense of the code we had in regards to the output.
- finetune the model: figured out a flaw: the dataset had varying ranges of scores for different sets which we accidentally mistook as same score, hence working on a new approach of fine tuning each essay set
- working on another approach of utilizing just a set of data to use a common range and see how the model performs

Task next week: finalize the model and merge with rest of the code
