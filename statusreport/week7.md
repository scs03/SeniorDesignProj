Sruti Karthikeyan - 10

Tasks Completed:

Attempted initial model setup using DistilRoBERTa with a custom regression head, but transitioned to Flan-T5 after architectural limitations and instability (e.g., NaNs)

Successfully fine-tuned a Flan-T5 model for trait-based essay scoring using normalized rubric-guided prompts from ASAP AES Sets 7 and 8

Evaluated and validated the model's scoring behavior on high- and low-quality essays, and saved the complete pipeline for future use

Tasks Next Week:

Focus on improving model output quality and consistency by refining rubric prompts, testing edge cases, and iterating on feedback handling


Nihanth Attaluri - 10

Tasks Completed:
	- Connected hugging face inference so model is ready for plug and 		play
	- Tested OpenAI trait pulling to ensure correct traits are being pulled 		from multiple rubrics
	- Merged code into main (had a branch that was really far behind, took a bit with merge conflicts)

Tasks next week: Continue to move forward with model progression
